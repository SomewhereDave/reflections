When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    It allows for multiple contributors to colaborate to the same project from different machines. It also functions as a backup in case a
    local machine crashes and looses its remote.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Automatic updates may interfer with your local repository. Imagine, for instance, that a different user removed code that is necessary for some of your actual changes to work. Also automatic changes may distract you from the work at hand as you will need to review remote changes in order to understand what is going on in the latest version. You also might want to wait until a branch is merged into the master to review only the final version of a feature instead of different states during commits. Thus, manual pulls let you avoid "mental overhead"
